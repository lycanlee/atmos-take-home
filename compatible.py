First Thoughts:
Being a rectangular polygon I can respresent that as a matrix of 0s and 1s where 0s is it being outside of the boundary and 1 being within the boundary
Need to create matrix from coordinates
When I have matrix I can then build an algorithm to determine if the house fits.

Things to think about and assumptions:
- Are length and width integers? (will start with assuming so for simplicity, can easy scale everything later)
- Going to start by assuming that boundaries and rectangular polygon will be parallel (no rotation required)
- Assuming length and width are supplied in the same unit of measurement
- Assuming coordinates will fit into the 2D grid provided and I do not need to scale the grid
